## 🔄 How The System Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Interview Practice Flow                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. 🎤 User speaks → Browser captures audio via Web Speech API

2. 📝 Speech-to-Text → Converts audio to text transcript

3. 🚀 Send to Gemini → POST /api/gemini/interview
   - Includes: user transcript + conversation history
   - Gemini acts as interviewer (system prompt)

4. 🤖 AI Response → Gemini generates interviewer question/feedback
