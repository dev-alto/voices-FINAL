- Asks questions about specific topics user needs to cover

### 4. **All Existing Features Preserved**
- ✅ Camera/video with device selection
- ✅ Microphone controls

## 🎮 How It Works

### **For Users:**

1. Navigate to any practice scenario:
   - http://localhost:3000/practice/party
   - http://localhost:3000/practice/classroom
   - http://localhost:3000/practice/job-interview
   - http://localhost:3000/practice/de-escalation
   - http://localhost:3000/practice/presentation

2. **AI Interviewer Toggle** (in left sidebar):
   - ON (default): Uses Gemini AI interviewer

3. **Camera & Audio**:
   - Your video appears in the left panel
   - Microphone captures your speech continuously
   - STT converts speech to text automatically

4. **Conversation Loop**:
   ```
   You speak → STT → Gemini processes → AI responds → TTS speaks it
   ```

5. **AI automatically**:
   - Asks scenario-appropriate questions
   - References your talking points
   - Stays in character for the scenario
   - Provides realistic practice

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/practice/[scenarioId]/page.tsx` - Main practice page

### **New State Added:**
```typescript
const [useGeminiInterviewer, setUseGeminiInterviewer] = useState(true);
const [geminiConversationHistory, setGeminiConversationHistory] = useState([]);
const [isGeminiProcessing, setIsGeminiProcessing] = useState(false);
```

### **New Functions:**
1. `handleGeminiInterviewerResponse()` - Sends user speech to Gemini API
2. `buildScenarioSystemPrompt()` - Creates context-aware system prompts

### **Modified Functions:**
1. Speech recognition handler now routes to Gemini or agents based on toggle
2. Initial greeting uses Gemini when enabled
3. UI displays processing indicator
