# üîß Fixes Applied - Gemini AI Interviewer

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ‚úÖ STT Not Working
**Problem:** Speech recognition wasn't starting automatically

**Fix:**
- Added async initialization for media setup
- Added 500ms delay after microphone initialization before starting STT
- Added console logging for debugging
- Ensured STT starts only after microphone permissions granted

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Initial media setup with proper async/await
useEffect(() => {
  const initMedia = async () => {
    if (isVideoOn) {
      await startCamera();
    }
    await startMicrophone();
    
    // Give a small delay for microphone to initialize, then start STT
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!isMuted && speechRecognitionSupported) {
        console.log("Starting speech recognition after media init...");
        startListening();
      }
    }, 500);
  };
  
  initMedia();
  // ... cleanup
}, []);
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Gemini Not Loading for Each Scenario
**Problem:** Initial greeting wasn't calling Gemini properly due to async issues

**Fix:**
- Wrapped initial Gemini call in proper async function
- Ensured agents are generated before calling Gemini
- Added dependency on `useGeminiInterviewer` in useEffect
- Improved error handling with fallback greeting

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... generate agents
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (useGeminiInterviewer && generatedAgents.length > 0) {
      // Properly wrapped async Gemini call
      const initGreeting = async () => {
        // Call Gemini with scenario-specific system prompt
        // ...
      };
      initGreeting();
    } else {
      // Regular agent greeting
    }
  }, 2000);
}, [scenario, useGeminiInterviewer]);
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Voice Not Switching Between Responses
**Problem:** Always used first agent's voice for all Gemini responses

**Fix:**
- Added `currentAgentIndex` state to track which agent voice to use
- Rotates through all available agents using modulo
- Each Gemini response uses a different agent's voice
- Provides variety and makes conversation more dynamic

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added state
const [currentAgentIndex, setCurrentAgentIndex] = useState(0);

// In handleGeminiInterviewerResponse:
// Rotate through agents for different voices
const aiAgent = agents[currentAgentIndex % agents.length] || agents[0];

// Move to next agent for next response
setCurrentAgentIndex(prev => prev + 1);

// Use agent's specific voiceId for TTS
ttsService.queueSpeech({
  text: assistantText,
  agentName: aiAgent.name,
  messageId: aiMessage.id,
  voiceId: aiAgent.voiceId, // Different voice each time!
});
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Bonus: Improved Toggle Behavior
**Problem:** Toggle was disabled after first message

**Fix:**
- Changed toggle to only disable during Gemini processing
- Allows switching between AI and agents at any time
- Better user control

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
<Switch
  checked={useGeminiInterviewer}
  onCheckedChange={setUseGeminiInterviewer}
  disabled={isGeminiProcessing} // Only disable while processing
/>
```

## How Voice Rotation Works:

### Scenario: Job Interview (4 agents)

**Turn 1 (Greeting):**
- Agent: Alex (voice: b5f4515fd395410b9ed3aef6fa51d9a0)
- Message: "Hello! Thank you for joining today..."

**Turn 2 (User speaks, Gemini responds):**
- Agent: Sarah (voice: 933563129e564b19a115bedd57b7406a)
- Message: "That's interesting! Can you tell me more..."

**Turn 3 (User speaks, Gemini responds):**
- Agent: Mike (voice: f3e8c5bbead746e29d47d38a146247ff)
- Message: "Great answer. How did you handle..."

**Turn 4 (User speaks, Gemini responds):**
- Agent: Emma (voice: fbae2ecb433e41a29495707efbc594b5)
- Message: "I appreciate that perspective..."

**Turn 5 (User speaks, Gemini responds):**
- Agent: Alex again (cycles back)
- Message: "One more question..."

## Testing Checklist:

### ‚úÖ STT Working:
1. Open any practice scenario
2. Grant microphone permissions
3. Wait 2-3 seconds
4. You should see green "Listening" indicator
5. Speak - you'll see interim transcript
6. Final transcript becomes a message

### ‚úÖ Gemini Loading Per Scenario:
1. Visit each scenario:
   - `/practice/party`
   - `/practice/classroom`
   - `/practice/job-interview`
   - `/practice/de-escalation`
   - `/practice/presentation`
2. Each should get appropriate greeting
3. Check console for: "Starting speech recognition after media init..."

### ‚úÖ Voice Switching:
1. Start any practice session
2. Speak several times
3. Listen to AI responses
4. Each response should have a different voice
5. Voices should cycle through all agents

### ‚úÖ Toggle Switching:
1. Start session with AI Interviewer ON
2. Have a few exchanges
3. Toggle OFF - should switch to regular agents
4. Toggle ON - should switch back to Gemini
5. Should work at any time (not just at start)

## Debugging Tips:

### If STT Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify microphone permissions (camera icon in address bar)
3. Look for: "Starting speech recognition after media init..." log
4. Try Chrome or Edge (best STT support)

### If Gemini Not Responding:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify Gemini API key is correct
3. Check Network tab for `/api/gemini/interview` calls
4. Look for error messages in chat

### If All Voices Sound Same:
1. Check TTS is enabled (toggle in settings)
2. Verify `TTS_ENABLED=true` in `.env.local`
3. Check Fish Audio API key is valid
4. Look at agent names - they should rotate (Alex, Sarah, Mike, Emma, etc.)
